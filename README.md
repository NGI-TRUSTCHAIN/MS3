# MS3 - Modular Web3 Suite

> **IMPORTANT NOTE:** This project is under development and subject to changes over time.

## Overview

MS3 is a revolutionary approach to Web3 integration, designed to make existing blockchain solutions more reusable and composable. Instead of repeatedly integrating the same tools for each project, MS3 allows you to compose and reuse pre-configured integrations through a modular adapter system.

## Key Benefits

- **Leverage Existing Solutions:** Use battle-tested tools like Web3Onboard or OpenZeppelin Wizard as plug-and-play adapters
- **Seamless Composability:** Mix and match different solutions that automatically work together
- **Flexible Deployment:** Use our hosted solution or build your own solution with our modular packages
- **Multi-Chain Support:** Built-in support for multi-chain and cross-chain operations
- **Version Control:** Run multiple versions of the same adapter simultaneously

## Architecture

### Module System

MS3 is built around three core modules, each supporting multiple adapters:

#### 1. Wallet Module
- Handles wallet connectivity and management
- Supports multiple wallet solutions simultaneously
- Example: One project can use both Web3Auth and Web3Onboard adapters

#### 2. Smart Contract Development & Interactions
- Contract generation, validation and interaction
- Standardized templates and customization
- Contract deployment and interaction
- Multi-chain support per contract
- Example: OpenZeppelin Wizard adapter for standard contracts, Ethers/Hardhat adapter for full contract lifecycle

#### 3. Cross-Chain Operations
- Inter-chain asset and data movement
- Bridge integrations
- Example: Chainlink adapter for cross-chain operations

### Module-to-Module Communication

Modules communicate through predefined connection points:

```typescript
interface Module {
  // Connection points define how modules interact
  connectionPoints: {
    provides: {
      "web3Provider": Web3Provider,
      "contractInstance": ContractInstance
    },
    requires: {
      "walletProvider": WalletProvider,
      "contractABI": ContractABI
    }
  }
}
```

#### Example Flow:

```
Wallet Module (Web3Auth) → SC Interaction Module (Ethers)
└── Provides Web3Provider  └── Uses provider for contract calls
```
